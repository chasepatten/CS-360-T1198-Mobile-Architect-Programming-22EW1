Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

  -My app is meant to allow a user to sign up with an account to an inventory management application. The user will be able to add, remove, update, and read the different items inside the database. They will be notified whenever an item is getting low or has run out. The user needs this app was designed to address are the need for a lightweight and simple application used for inventory tracking and management.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

  -The first screen is the Login/Sign up screen. This screen is needed to authorize the user to use the application and have access to the database. The inventory screen itself shows the item name and how many are currently in stock. It also allows the user to delete a row from the database if wanted. I feel that the GUI designs were successful as they meet all the required needs. The functions that run them themselves is a different story.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

  -I tried to use my experience from my previous class on database management. However, even though we used SQLite in that class, it was coded in Python. I am much more experienced with Python then I am Java. It was difficult at this time to make the conversion.
  
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
  
  -I tried to test it every point of the way but, due to my inexperience, I was unable to get it fully working.
  
Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
  
  -By innovating, I don't think I did. I did not come up with anything new. But, working with Java in order to interface with a database is definitely something new for me. I learned a lot from it.
  
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
  
  -I think I was particularly successful at the GUI design. I have worked on the front end before with some of my basic projects at home. I have only experience with TKinter. This was eye opening in terms of how an Android app is developed.
